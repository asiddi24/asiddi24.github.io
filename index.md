Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. My research focuses on large scale physical oceanography and I am broadly interested in the ocean's role in modulating Earth's climate. 

I use a combination of theory and modeling tools to look for answers in my dissertation research, which focuses on decadal variability in salinity and temperature in the subpolar north Atlantic. 

Outside of research, I am interested in the history of the field of climate science. I am also an organizer for my graduate worker union, TRU-UE. Feel free to get in touch with me if you're interested in learning more about these things. Also, Baltimore is the greatest city in America.

I am graduating sometime in the summer of 2024 and looking for postdoc opportunities beginning later this year.
